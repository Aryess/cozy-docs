<p>
We dreamt of an internet where we would not have to compromise our privacy
everytime we wish to benefit from a service. An internet where we are not
obliged to manage 25 accounts and passwords. Where we could search in
our entire data with a single request. We dreamt of a web where it would be
easy to create our applications and where they can collaborate. 
In short, <strong>we dreamt of web services at OUR service.</strong>
</p>

</p>

<p>
Today we have the great honor to pose the first brick of our ideal! We
published the first version of <strong>Cozy, a personal cloud that unites
your web applications and your data on your hardware. </strong> With a single
click you can deploy your services on your personal computer in the comfort of
your living-room, on a dedicated server or even on a mini board such as the
Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<p>
This first version named "Snowden" as homage to the person the NSA hates the
most. He provided us with proofs of what we have suspected: the cloud is not a
paradise. It has helped us tremendously in explaining the benefits of cozy,
we are grateful for his work.
</p>

<p>
The platform is now ready to welcome new and improved applications. Here are
the newest modifications made to the Core of Cozy:
<ul>
<li>
The main User Interface has been fully redesigned and is now customisable
</li>
<li>
We lowered the memory footprint of the stack.
Cozy can run several applications with less than 512MB of RAM.
</li>
<li>
We provide three ready to go images for Virtualbox, Raspberry Pi and OpenVZ.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
To conclude here are the goals of the project:
</p>


<p style="text-align: left">
<em>Short term</em><br />
Cozy will provide first-class agenda and contact applications,
Mailpile will be integrated. 25 apps will be available and the Github repo will
reach 500 stars. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<em>Mid term</em><br />
Cozy becomes the perfect backend for Firefox OS and the
application deployer will be based on Docker.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<em>Long term</em><br />
 Cozy is the gravity center of your digital life. Through it, all
your devices and sensors collaborate together for you and your contacts. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; padding-top: 20px">
Cozy 1.0 "Snowden"  has arrived, take advantage of your personal cloud and
browse the web with your data in the palm of your hands.
