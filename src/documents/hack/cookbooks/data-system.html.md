# The Data System API

The Data System API allows the access of the following:

* the data themselves
* the CouchDB views (through "requests")
* the attachements (files)
* the indexer
* the accounts

## Generic notes

All the responses body are encoded in JSON and all the data you send along requests should be encoded in JSON.

You will find HTTP status code for response, here is what they mean:

* 200: success
* 201: success (and something has been created)
* 204: success (and something has been deleted)
* 400: bad request
* 401: unauthorized
* 403: not authentificated
* 404: document not found
* 409: document already exists
* 500: internal server error

All the requests that mention "Requires authentification and authorization" are likely to send 401 and 403 if the conditions are not met.
See [troubleshootings](#troubleshootings) to understand what those error mean.

### Todo for this cookbook
* Adding documentation about authentification and authorization process

## Data API

This API lets you manage data with four common operations: create, read, update and delete but utiliy functions like exist, find or merge can also help you.

# Example of use
How to request the Data System from a NodeJS application ? You can use any HTTP client but we recommend (, use and maintain) request-json:

```bash
npm install request-json --save
```

```javascript
Client = require('request-json').JsonClient;

// The data system listens to localhost:9101
dataSystem = new Client('http://localhost:9101');

// In production we must authentificate the application
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  user = process.env.NAME;
  password = process.env.TOKEN;
  dataSystem.setBasicAuth(user, password);
}

// The request must be created first, let's say it is
dataSystem.post('/request/alarm/all/', function(err, res, body) {
  if(err !== null || (res !== null && res.statusCode != 200)) {
    if(res !== null) {code = res.statusCode;} else { code = "no status code"; }
    console.log("An error occurred -- [" + code + "] " + err);
  }
  else {
    console.log("List of all the alarms");
    console.log(body);
  }
}
});
```
