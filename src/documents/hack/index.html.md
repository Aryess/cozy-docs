Let's be clear before going anywhere: **writing a web app for Cozy is like writing a web app.**

And you might know that making web applications can be a real pain:

* you need to chose a programing language for the server side
* you need to chose a framework for it
* you need to chose languages to build the client side
* you need frameworks and tools to help you with it
* you need to make everything work together
* then only you can start writing your application

Cozy aims at making web application development more straightforward so you can focus on your application only.

We will guide you through the creation of an app. You will see that there are multiple ways to achieve it!

Freedom of choice is not always a good thing when you don't know where to start so we'll introduce you our favorite tools already configured into a skeleton.

Note you will still be able to create, use and share your own skeletons depending on your preferences.

Get ready for **painless web development** with Cozy! (insert Frank's presentation here).
