# Application Skeletons
Because Cozy is a [pPaas](/hack/getting-started/architecture-overview.html#The-pPaaS), you can use the frameworks you like to build your applications. The [Cozy manager](https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-manager/) CLI tool provides a command to create skeletons. Currently there are the following skeletons:

* [Cozy official (JavaScript)](/hack/application-skeletons/cozy-official.html): Americano/JugglingDB + Single page app with Backbone
* [Cozy official (CoffeeScript)](/hack/application-skeletons/cozy-official.html): Americano/JugglingDB + Single page app with Backbone

Feel free to propose your own template, send us an email to contact[at]cozycloud.cc and we'll add it. Don't forget to make a page of documentation we'll add here!
