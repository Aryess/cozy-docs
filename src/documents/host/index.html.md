# Host

You will find here the required resources to setup your Cozy on your own
server. There you will find the informations to run the right commands on your
target server to setup. We will add soon ways to try Cozy via a virtual machine
and VirtualBox, to setup Cozy on a Raspberry Pi through a dedicated image and
already configured containers (OpenVZ, Docker).
