# Contributing to Cozycloud

You can contribute to Cozy in many ways, wether you are a NodeJS Ninja or a Net-Citizen willing to protect her/his privacy, all contributions are welcome! Report a bug, submit a feature request or improve the documentation to ease self-hosting, using or developing for Cozy. **There's something for everyone!**

Everything is open-source and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/mycozycloud/), this page will explain you how can help.


## Reporting a bug, submutting a feature request

We use Github's issues to report the bugs or submit a feature request. On each page of the documentation you will find the link to the related Github page to achieve this.

Try to be as descriptive as possible and add screenshots if you can, espescially for bug reports.


## The documentation

You can improve the documentation you are currently reading by modifying and submitting us a pull request on the [dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/jsilvestre/cozy-docs/).
